# Security

## Symmetric key system

encrypted message: Ka(m)

decrypt message using: Kb(Ka(m))

## Public key encryption

Kb+ public ecryption key

kb- private decryption key

Alice encrypt text using Bob's public key: Kb+(m)

Bob decryt text using private key: Kb-(Kb+(m))

### problem

1. intruder may insert or change the message as everyone know Bob's public key Kb+(m)

2. anyone can send an encrypted message to Bob

## RSA encryption algorithm

exponentiation to the power of e or d

why RSA works:no known algorithms for quickly factoring a number

## Session key

DES is much faster than RSA

if a large data is being sent, RSA is used to encrpt a symmetric key that is used to encrypt the data

## Message integrity

> cryptographic hash function is used to ensure this

1. the message indeed originated from Alice
2. the message is not tampered with on its way to Bob

for any text x, y, it's impossible to find H(x)=H(y)

### message authentication code (MAC)

s: shared secret between Alice and Bob

MAC = H(m+s)

Alice appends MAC to the message m, (m, H(m+s))

Bob receive (m, h), Bob calculates H(m+s) according to s, compare H(m+s) and h to ensure integrity

## Digital Signature

first use hash then use private key, because message is smaller after being hashed

Kb-(H(m))

## Public key certification

when Alice wants to communicate with Bob using public key cryptography, she needs to verity the public key that is supposed to be Bob's is indeed Bob's

otherwise anyone can pretend to be Bob

## Certificate Authority (CA)

verity that an entity is who it says it is

once the CA verifies the identity of the entity, the CA creates a certificate that binds the public key of the entity to the identity

## SSL (security socket layrer)

version 3 also called Transport Layer Security(TLS)

has three handshakes after TCP handshakes to establish security connection

Bob -syn-> Alice
Bob <-synack- Alice
Bob -ack-> Alice
Bob -SSL hello-> Alice
Bob <-certificate- Alice
Bob ---- EMS = Ka+(MS) ----> Alice (Bob encrypted master key using Alice's public key Ka+)
then Alice decrypts EMS with KA- to get master key

then MS is used to gnerate for both directions

E: ssession encryption key for data sent

M: session MAC key for data sent from Bob to Alice

## SSL certificate

1. do we trust the CA?
2. is the certificate time valid?
3. is the crtificate revoked?
4. does the "common name" match the website in the address bar?
