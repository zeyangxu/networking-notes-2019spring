# Link Layer

all connected component consider as **nodes**, doesn't care it is server or client or router

**nodes**: include hosts, routers, witches and WIFI access points

**links**: communication channels that connect adjacent nodes along the com-munication path

**link-layer frame**: Over a given link, a transmitting node encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame and transmits the frame into the link

all components are directed connected

## Context

- Ethernet (wired)
- 802.11 (wireless)

## Service

- encapsulate datagram into frame: header, data, trailer(i'm done)
- chanel access if shared medium
- MAC address (6 bytes), bind to your device

### half-duplex and full-duplex

half-duplex: two node can't talk at the same time

## implemented

> link layer done in both CPU and NIC

CPU: application, transport, network, link

NIC: link, physical

NIC (network interface card) or in a chip

## Error detection

EDC : Error Detection Code

### parity checking

add a parity bit to the end of the data

receive even sum data: add 0 parity

receive odd sum data: add 1 parity

sum of all bits together with parity bit is odd, there is an error, throw it away

### checksum method

the receiver checks the checksum by taking the 1s complement of the sum of the received data (including the checksum) and checking whether the result is all 1 bits. If any of the bits are 0, an error is indicated

### Cyclic redundancy check

> a better error detection, used in practice

D: data bits, R: CRC bits

d + r is exactly divisible by G

receiver divide d + r by G

use modulo-2 arithmetic to calculate

## Multiple access links, protocols

to avoid collision (two nodes talks at the same time)

### point to point

ganruantee to have only 2 nodes in the network

the point-to-point pro-tocol (PPP) and high-level data link control (HDLC)

used in Ethernet, switches, host

### broadcast (shared wire or medium)

Ethernet and wireless LANs are examples of broadcast link-layer technologies

**collide**: all nodes are capable of transmitting frames, more than two nodes can transmit frames at the same time. When this happens, all of the nodes receive multiple frames at the same time; that is, the transmitted frames collide

### FDM

frequency divition multiplexing

different node send in different frequency chanel for the whole time

### TDM

time divition multiplexing

you get complete chanel, but within a limit of time

### random access

figure it out ourselves

when a node experiences a collision, it doesnâ€™t necessarily retransmit the frame right away.

Instead it waits a random delay before retransmitting the frame. Each node involved in a collision chooses inde-pendent random delay

**Slotted ALOHA protocol**

- all frames same size
- time divided into equal size slots
- nodes start to transmit only slot begining
- if 2 or more nodes transmit in slot, all nodes detect collision

- if collision: node retransmits frame in each subsequent slot

> if more than two nodes are transmitting

| node1 | 1   | 1   |     | 1   | 1   |     |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| node2 | 2   | 2   | 2   |     |     |     |
| node3 | 3   | -   | -   | 3   |     | 3   |

### Pure (unslotted) ALOHA

when a frame first arrives (that is, a network-layer datagram is passed down from the network layer at the sending node), the node immediately transmits the frame in its entirety into the broadcast channel

If a transmitted frame experiences a collision with one or more other transmissions, the node will then immediately (after completely transmitting its collided frame) retransmit the frame

### CSMA

> if you see somebody is talking, don't talk

listen before transmit

- if channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
- if sensed busy: defer transmission

problem: what if someone don't stop, got to have a limit

channel propagation delay: the delay one node detect there is another transmit after it begins transmit

### CSMA collision

abort transmission when inteference is detected

### taking turns

polling protocols: master node polls each node in a round-robin fashion

token-passing protocol: a token is passing around each node
