# Physical Layer

power and data in a single wire

## Wireless

wireless: might just 1Gps in good condition

## Wire (copper transport electric)

wire: 10 Gps

### coaxial

noise: emission electrons that jump around

use groud put wire shielding around the wire: negative and positive cancel out each other

twist two wire together: cross-talk is interfier between adj. wire

four colors of cable: blue, orange, brown, green

two colors: white blue wire

ethernet specify
568B 8 ports:

| w/o | orange | w/g | blue | w/b | green | w/brown | brown |
| --- | ------ | --- | ---- | --- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| 1   | 2      | 3   | 4    | 5   | 6     | 7       | 8     |
| TX+ | TX-    | RX+ |      |     | RX-   |         |       |

can do send and receive at the same time

### Jacket Type connector

RJ45: 8 cable (ethernet)
RJ12: 4 cable (telephone)
they are compatable

### HUB/Switch

HUB: no intelligence, it relays electric signals, no segregation, everybody gets everything

Switch: has intelligence, relays only those packets destined for that outlet(port)

has a little CPU that remembers port

### Chained Switches

in a broadcast domain, chain switches to exceed 100 meters limit

## Fiber Optic (transport light)

Low resistence than copper, travel further

### single mode

can't hard bend

80km

### multi-mode

multiple wave-length to multiplex signals
