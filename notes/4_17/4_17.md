# Routing Algorithm

LS (link state) and DV (distance vector)

### Global strategy

- all router have complete topology
- every router can figure oute new route once something is down
- usually use in small network

### Decentralized

- only know neighbors
- smaller bandwidth
- take more time when stablize from breakdown

## Link-State Routing Algorithm

> Using global strategy Implement Dijkstra's algorithm

The result of the nodes’ broadcast is that all nodes have an identical and complete view of the network

## Distance Vector Algorithm

> using decentralized strategy

not robust as LS, when one router is down, verything would be affected

## Hierarchical Routing

### Autonomous System (AS)

> solve the scale and administrative autonomuy problem of LS and DV

Routers within the same AS all run the same routing algorithm (for example, an LS or DV algorithm) and have information about each other

### Intra-autonomous system routing protocol

The routing algorithm running within an autonomous system

### gateway router

router that responsible for forwarding packets to destinations outside the AS

netflix -> verizon -> spectrum

verizon want to charge netflix for forwarding traffic to spectrum

Intra and inter AS routing algorithm

#### Intra

how to get to AS inside AS system

RIP and OSPF are used

#### Inter

how to get to other AS

BGP is used

## RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

> RIP is a distance-vector protocol that operates in a manner very close to the idealized DV protocol

RIP uses the term hop, which is the number of subnets traversed along the shortest path from source router to destination subnet, including the des-tination subnet.

router boradcast the information of distance

limiting the use of RIP to autonomous systems that are fewer than 15 hops in diameter

if no advertisement heard after 180 sec -> link declared dead

## OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

> a LS protocol

With OSPF, a router constructs a complete topological map (that is, a graph) of the entire autonomous system.

The router then locally runs Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to determine a shortest-path tree to all subnets, with itself as the root node.

OSPF does not mandate a policy for how link weights are set (that is the job of the network administrator)

A router broadcasts link-state information whenever there is a change in a link’s state (for example, a change in cost or a change in up/down status)

## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

> how paths are determined for source-destination pairs that span multiple ASs

1. Obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASs
2. Propagate the reachability information to all routers internal to the AS
3. Determine “good” routes to subnets based on the reachability information and on AS policy
