# MAC protocols continue

## CSMA collisions

when two +3 signal collide, at the middle it becomes +6

when voltage excced 5 volts, everybody stops

## Collision Detection(CD)

### Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm

when collide, send a jamming message, both end wait for a random number of time

### efficiency

## "Taking Turns" MAC protocols

not efficient, used for fire alarm system

### pollling

master device keep asking each slave device

### token passing

control token passed from one node to next sequentially

## Cable access network

used to be one direction

divide the wire into different frequency, enable bi-direction

# Swiched Local Network

> instead of using IP address, LAN use local address like MAC

## MAC addresses and ARP

> adapters(network interfaces) has MAC addresses

32-bit IP address

48-bit MAC address: frist 3 octal assign to a corporation

MAC use hex notation like 5C-66-AB-90-75-B1

## ARP: address resolution protocol

how to figure out MAC address using someone's IP address

### ARP table

store the association between MAC address and IP address

send/receive ARP via wireless access point(WAP), but not required, can also communicate dirrectlly between devices
