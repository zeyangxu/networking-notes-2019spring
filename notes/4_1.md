## Fragmentation

spliting up packets

When a router needs to fragment a datagram, each resulting datagram (that is, fragment) is stamped with the **source address**, **destination address**, and **identification number** of the original datagram.

the last fragment has a **flag bit** set to 0, whereas all the other fragments have this **flag bit** set to 1

the **offset** field is used to specify where the fragment fits within the original IP datagram

> MTU = 1500 bytes, so each fragment = 1480 bytes data + 20 bytes IP header

| Fragment     | Bytes     | ID                 | Offset     | Flag                 |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 1st fragment | 1480bytes | identification=777 | offset=0   | flag=1(there's more) |
| 2nd fragment | 1480bytes | identification=777 | offset=185 | flag=1(there's more) |
| 3rd fragment | 1020bytes | identification=777 | offset=370 | flag=0(last segment) |

### MTU

maximum transition unite

### IPv4 Datagram Format

- Version number
- Header length
- Type of service
- Datagram length

- Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset
- Time-to-live: This field is decremented by one each time the datagram is processed by a router.
- Protocol: upper layer protocol. TCP - 6, UDP - 17
- Header checksum: checksum is computed by treating each 2 bytes in the header as a number and summing these numbers using 1s complement arithmetic
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Options: rarely use
- Data: transport layer segment or other types of data like ICMP message

#### Interface

The boundary between the host/router and the physical link is called an interface

router can have many interfaces, each for different links

IP address is associated with interface, rather than with host/router

## IP addressing

each IP address is 32-bit long (4 bytes)

each byte of the address is written in its decimal form and is separated by a period (dot) from other bytes in the address

### dotted-decimal notation

for IP address 192.32.216.9

| 193      | 32       | 216      | 9        |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 11000001 | 00100000 | 11011000 | 00001001 |

> except for interfaces behind NATs, as discussed at the end of this section

Each interface on every host and router in the global Internet must have an IP address that is globally unique

## Subnet

The network interconnecting multiple host interfaces and one router interface via Ethernet LAN

leftmost 24 bits of the 32-bit quantity define the subnet address

### subnet mask

the /24 notation, known as a subnet mask, indicates that the leftmost **24 bits** of the 32-bit quantity define the subnet address

| subnet 223.1.1.0/24 |
| ------------------- |
| 223.1.1.1           |
| 223.1.1.2           |
| 223.1.1.3           |
| 223.1.1.4           |
| ...                 |

### Network is divided into classes by size

Before **CIDR** was adopted, the network portions of an IP address were con-strained to be 8, 16, or 24 bits in length, an addressing scheme known as classful addressing

> Determine if routing is neccessary by first octet, or the destination is on the directly connected network

**Host**: how many divice can connect to your device

- class A: 8 network bits, 24 host bits

  | Network | Host    |
  | ------- | ------- |
  | 10      | 20.30.4 |

- class B: 16 network bits, 16 host bits

  | Network | Host |
  | ------- | ---- |
  | 120.32  | 17.4 |

- class C: 24 network bits, 8 host bits

  | Network  | Host |
  | -------- | ---- |
  | 193.15.7 | 4    |
